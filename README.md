# 对对碰 Mystic Clash: A Fantasy Tactical RPG ⚔️✨  

### Overview  
**Mystic Clash** is a turn-based tactical RPG set in a **Western fantasy** world of magic and mystery (but with voices in Chinese). This project is my personal exercise in mastering **Python OOP principles** and managing **large-scale file structures**. It’s a work in progress, and I plan to keep expanding and improving it over time. It works based on seperated "game" logic and "animation" logic.
